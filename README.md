# Weapons of Destiny

A web app for comparing Legendary and Exotic weapons in Destiny 2

## Goals & Progress

Weapon data for Destiny 2 is scattered throughout the web - it's a bit of a pain to piece together the different bits of information (location, frame, stats, etc.) from all the lists and wikis out there. It's even harder to cross-compare stats.

I wanted to build a single app that accomplishes the following:

The basics (things other sites already do)

- [ ] Shows a table of weapons
- [ ] Responsive UI (i.e. works well on large and small screens)
- [ ] Sort by weapon attributes (e.g. "Impact")

Things I found missing from other sites:

- [ ] Lets you easily compare two or more weapons, side-by-side
- [ ] Lets you search for weapons with specific perks (e.g. "High-caliber Rounds")
- [ ] Lists weapon frames (e.g "Lightweight")
- [ ] Shows weapon locations/vendors
